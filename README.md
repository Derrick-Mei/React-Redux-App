# Module Project: Async Redux - React Redux App

## Instructions
1. Choose an open api ([this list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
   1. look for ones with `Auth: no` and `HTTPS: yes` - or just do a google search for `open apis`).
2. Create React App
3. Build Folders and Files
4. connect api
5. create async action creator
6. handle possible ui states

## Minimum Viable Product

- [ ] Build a React Redux app
- [ ] Fetch data inside an async action creator from an API of your choosing
- [ ] Add the data from the API to the Redux store
- [ ] Display the data from the store in a component
- [ ] _Some_ styling must be applied. It can be basic, but the app must not only use browser default stylings

## Stretch Problems

- [ ] Advanced Styling
- [ ] redux hooks
- [ ] A second API
- [ ] Input to fetch data dynamically
